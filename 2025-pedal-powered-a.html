									<h1>An Exploration of Pedal-Powered Liquid Dispensers</h1>
									<p>Andrew Reinhard Dilisto</p>
								</header>
								<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
								<p>The increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among youth has been linked to rising
obesity and type 2 diabetes rates, prompting health policy responses such as indirect taxation on sug-
ary drinks. This project proposes an innovative, health-conscious alternative: a pedal-powered liquid
dispenser. The device encourages physical activity by requiring users to pedal to access sugary drinks
by converting kinetic energy from a pedaling motion to electrical energy to power a liquid pump. The
system utilizes a bike-mounted AC generator, a voltage step-up transformer, a DC power supply, and
an Arduino-controlled circuit integrated with a load cell and a relay module to manage the flow of the
liquid. The project promotes environmental sustainability, physical recreation, and behavioral change in
consumption habits, despite the challenges faced by the current prototype, such as overly rapid liquid
dispensing. Enhancements such as PWM-controlled MOSFETs and calorie tracking position it as a
creative intervention in the public health landscape.</p>
<h2>2. Introduction</h2>
<p>Sugar-sweetened drinks have experienced an increase in consumption. From 1990 to 2018, sugar-
sweetened beverages among children and adolescents rose by 23%. A subsequent rise also follows this in
obesity rates (Lara-Castor, 2024). The rising prevalence of sugar-sweetened beverages across diets poses
potential long-term health risks, contributing to excess weight gain and type 2 diabetes (Lara-Castor,
2025). To tackle these problems, governments have taken preventative measures such as introducing an
excise (indirect) tax on sugar-sweetened drinks by the Indonesian Ministry of Finance starting July 2025
(Mulya, 2025). This is particularly due to the high rates of diabetes within the country, as it affects
around 10% of the population. This project presents another solution: pedal-powered dispensers.
Pedal-powered dispensers are liquid dispensing apparatus that are powered by a pedalling action.
Kinetic energy from the pedals is transformed into electrical energy by an AC generator (WikiBooks,
n.d.), which is used to power a DC pump that will allow the liquid to be transferred for consumption.
This project aims to promote physical exercise to consumers of sugar-sweetened drinks engagingly and
uniquely, while also exploring alternative, sustainable possibilities in powering electrical appliances.</p>
<h2>3. Methodology</h2>
The components of the project are divided into two parts, the former being the generator circuit and
the latter being the control circuit that includes the pump. In summary, AC flows from the generator
circuit to the control circuit, which is then stepped up using a step-up transformer (Maier & Appleton,
n.d.). This is due to the input voltage range of the AC/DC converter. After the rectification of the AC,
some of it flows to power the Arduino UNO board, while the rest is used to power the DC pump. A
relay module is utilized to activate and deactivate the aforementioned pump.

<h3>3.2. Generator Circuit</h3>
<p>The generator circuit relies on kinetic motion to generate electricity to power the circuit. Friction
between the rear wheel and the generator rotates the magnet within the generator. Hence, the fixed coil
will cut the moving magnetic fields, creating a change in magnetic flux. According to Faradayâ€™s law of
electromagnetic induction, an induced electromotive force will be generated (Wikipedia, n.d.).</p>

<p>Figure 1: Outline of a fixed coil generator (Excel@Physics, n.d.)</p>
								<div class="image magna"><img src="docs/2025/pedal-powered/closeup.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Figure 2: Area of contact between the rear wheel and the AC generator</p>
								<p>The output current is then routed into the control circuit via electrical cables and a socket.</p>
<h3>3.3. Control Circuit</h3>
<p>The control circuit comprises the main mechanism that powers the pump. Its main goal is to rectify
the alternating current into usable direct current, while also powering and controlling other additional
components such as the Arduino UNO, the load cell, and the relay module. It is paramount to understand
that the output current of the generator circuit needs to pass through several stages before other electrical
components can utilize it. First and foremost, the voltage of the current must be increased to 220V by
the step-up transformer before routing it to a DC power supply. In this case, the power supply acts as a
rectifier that converts the alternating current to a direct current. This will be routed to two components:
the Arduino UNO board and the 12V DC pump.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="docs/2025/pedal-powered/schematic.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Figure 3: Schematic of the control circuit</p>
<p>As observed in the above schematic, a load cell and an HX-711 amplifier were implemented into the
system. This is to prevent hazardous liquid overflow and spillage by deactivating the pump once the
mass of the liquid reaches a predefined threshold. To do so, the mass of the liquid must be read regularly
by the load cell and checked by the Arduino UNO. Once it reaches the aforementioned threshold, the
Arduino UNO board will send a signal to the relay module to deactivate the pump to interrupt the flow
of the liquid. Moreover, a minimum mass value has been set to ensure that the pump will only activate
when the load cell detects a cup.</p>

<p>Figure 4: Flowchart of the algorithm</p>
<h2>4. Results</h2>
<p>The system successfully transported tap water from one container to another. A 5.5g polystyrene cup
was used during the trial. However, power from the generator circuit to the control circuit is sometimes
briefly interrupted, causing sudden stops in the liquidâ€™s motion. Overall, the prototype has met its initial
objective and is now subject to further improvements.</p>
<h2>5. Evaluation</h2>
<p>This system is still a prototype and thus has a spacious area for improvement. One of the major
flaws of the system is that the liquid flows too fast, such that the user does not expend as many calories
during the pedaling motion as expected. This could be fixed by adding a PWM-controlled MOSFET to
the circuit (MOSFET - Wikipedia, n.d.) instead of using a relay to control the DC pump. Moreover,
a calorie display system could also be implemented to provide the user with information regarding their
overall calorie expenditure.</p>
<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the pedal-powered liquid dispenser prototype offers a promising solution for reducing
sugar-sweetened drink consumption by integrating physical activity with beverage intake. This innovative
approach not only encourages healthier habits but also paves the way for enhancements that could further
enrich user experience and foster environmental sustainability. With continued development, the system
has the potential to significantly influence consumer behavior towards more health-conscious and eco-
friendly practices.</p>
